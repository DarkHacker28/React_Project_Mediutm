# Router Project Study

This project is a comprehensive study of router concepts and their implementation using **React**, **Node.js**, and other technologies. The aim is to understand routing in web applications, how it integrates with back-end systems, and how to optimize it for seamless navigation.

## Features

- **Client-Side Routing**: Implemented using React Router for dynamic and single-page applications.
- **Server-Side Routing**: Developed using Node.js to handle API requests and server-side rendering.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Code and examples showcasing the integration of other languages or frameworks.
- **Dynamic and Nested Routes**: Examples of dynamic URL parameters and nested routes.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid routes (404 pages).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) (React Router)
  - CSS/SCSS for styling
  - Additional tools: Redux, Tailwind CSS (optional)
- **Backend**:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with Express.js
  - Database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or SQLite, depending on the project)
- **Others**:
  - Axios or Fetch API for data fetching
  - Postman for API testing
